## 10.4 Hybrid Optimization

Hybrid methods may be required to solve particularly difficult real-world optimization problems. Implementation of hybrid methods typically requires non-trivial scripting because hybrids generally require a custom optimization workflow process. To illustrate this point, we describe a hybrid optimization method to solve a parameter estimation problem arising in the context of a model for childhood infectious disease transmission.

This parameter estimation model is a difficult nonconvex, nonlinear program for which no efficient solution algorithm exists to find global optima. To facilitate solution, the problem is reformulated using a MIP under-estimator and an NLP over-estimator. Information is exchanged using the two formulations, and the process is iterated until the two solutions converge.

Example 10.14 provides a Pyomo script that implements the hybrid search. Note that some initialization code is omitted from this example for clarity. In this example, user-defined Python functions are used to organize and modularize the optimization workflow. For example, the optimization model in this application is constructed via a function, disease.mdl. Example 10.14 includes a sketch of this function.

Beyond the standard Pyomo model constructs, we observe the ability to dynamically augment Pyomo models with arbitrary data, e.g., the definition of the p.t.LS and g.t.LS attributes; these are not model components, but rather raw Python data types. Pyomo itself is unaware of these attributes, but other components of a user-defined script can access and manipulate these attributes. Such a mechanism is invaluable when information is being propagated across disparate components of a
